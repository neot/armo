ARMO is provided as a OPENSHIFT Nodejs cartridge.

To instantiate the cartridge, follow the instructions:
If you already have an existing Nodejs application, go to step 2. Otherwise, start at step 1.

1. First create a Nodejs application on openshift. Give it the name and settings you want.

2. Once your application is running, we will add the cartridge.
   On the application back-office, follow the link "Or, see the entire list of cartridges you can add". 
   On the new page, paste the url "https://github.com/neot/armo/raw/master/metadata/manifest.yml" in the text field at the bottom. 
   Then click next and "Add Cartridge".

3. If all went well, you will be back to your application page with the list of cartridges installed.
   Note the informations displayed by the cartridge: the username and password to access the API. If forgotten, you can find it in the environnement variables OPENHIFT_ARMO_USER and OPENSHIFT_ARMO_PASSWORD.
